# Filebox with Only Bootstrap

In this project, we'll practice using Bootstrap.

## [Here is your target.](https://filebox-with-only-bootstrap.herokuapp.com/landing.html)

## Setup

1. Follow the [Getting Started with GitHub Guide](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-github.html) to download this code to your computer.
1. Open the entire folder in Atom (on Windows, File > Open Folder; on Mac, it's just File > Open, but click Open while you have a folder selected rather than drilling in).
1. Open `landing.html` in Chrome.

## Suggested Steps

 1. I have already downloaded and included Bootstrap in the project for you.
 2. I have also included an `additional_styles.css` with some standard vertical spacer classes.
 3. There are `<link>`s to both in the `<head>` of your starting point, but they are commented out. Uncomment them to use them.
 1. Use [Shoelace.io](http://shoelace.io/) to create a skeleton grid for your layout, and then copy-paste it into your page.
 2. Plug in your content to each cell in your skeleton. You can copy-paste from the target if you want to.
 3. You should be able to exactly match the target by only applying existing classes from either `bootstrap.css` or `additional_styles.css`; **you need not write any CSS rules yourself**.
